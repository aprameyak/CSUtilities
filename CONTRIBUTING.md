## Requesting Changes to Problem Tags

Since problem tags (such as company tags on LeetCode problems) are managed manually to ensure accuracy, **please do not submit direct pull requests for tag changes**.

Instead, if you notice an issue or want to suggest a new tag or modification:

### How to Request Tag Changes

1. **Open a new issue** on this repository
2. **Use the "Problem Tag Request" template** (if available) or clearly specify:
   - The problem number and name
   - The current tags (if any)
   - The suggested tag changes or additions
   - Any relevant sources or reasoning for the change

### Example Issue Format

```
**Problem:** #1 Two Sum

**Current Tags:**
- Companies: Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple
- Topics: Array, Hash Table

**Suggested Changes:**
- Add "Microsoft" to company tags
- Add "Two Pointers" to topics

**Reasoning:**
- Microsoft frequently asks this problem in interviews
- Two Pointers is an alternative solution approach

**Sources:**
- LeetCode discussion forums
- Interview experiences shared on Reddit
```

### What Happens Next

1. **Review Process**: Maintainers will review your request
2. **Verification**: We'll verify the information against reliable sources
3. **Update**: If approved, we'll update the tags in the codebase
4. **Notification**: You'll be notified when the changes are made

### Guidelines for Tag Requests

- **Be specific**: Include problem numbers and exact names
- **Provide sources**: Link to reliable sources when possible
- **Explain reasoning**: Help us understand why the change is needed
- **Be patient**: Manual verification takes time to ensure accuracy

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use proper prop typing

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design

### File Organization
- Keep components in `src/components/`
- Store types in `src/types/`
- Place data in `src/data/`

## Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

2. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

3. **Create a pull request:**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Fill out the PR template

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
